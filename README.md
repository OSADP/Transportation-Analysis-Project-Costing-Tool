Transportation Analysis Project Costing Tool
As part of the work on the FHWA guidance document titles “Scoping and Conducting Data-Driven 21st Century Transportation System Analyses”, the scoping tool is a spreadsheet tool that produces ballpark estimates of labor hours required for surface transportation analysis based on a small number of user inputs. Transportation agencies can use this scoping tool in developing preliminary scopes and budgets for their transportation analysis projects. The objectives of the scoping tool are: a) to inform a procurement decision made by a transportation agency before procuring transportation analysis services; b) to provide a rough order labor hour estimate for conducting the transportation analysis; and c) to incorporate an estimate of relative risk associated with various analysis tasks. The focus of the scoping tool is on traditional, off-line transportation project analysis; not on analysis conducted in real-time for the purpose of actively managing aspects of the transportation system. The focus of the tool is also on time-dynamic analytics such as all types of simulation and Highway Capacity Manual analysis, but not including travel demand modeling.
This application was developed by Cambridge Systematics with support from Noblis, Inc. under contract with the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). This tool was developed in conjunction with a guidance document titled “Scoping and Conducting Data-Driven 21st Century Transportation System Analyses” which will be publically available soon at: http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/index.htm.
